<h4>Historic Murals</h4>
<p>VOA’s headquarters is home to a series of historic murals commissioned by the U.S. government to depict the Social Security Act and other New Deal programs enacted in response to the Great Depression. Lithuanian-born artist Ben Shahn was selected in 1940 to paint the most prominent of the murals. Those wishing to view the murals should specify when contacting VOA to make special arrangements.</p>
